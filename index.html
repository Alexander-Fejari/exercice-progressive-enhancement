      The Universe itself is neither good nor bad, but a potential in
      permanent development.

    <p class="txt">
      Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that
      rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing
      cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s
      no such thing as an issue. Down here, the only reality is the one inside
      our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists
      neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we
      mis sense, our reality changes. That’s possible because our perception
      is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
      translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our
      reality changes depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change
      reality that much, everything’s fake. They’re proofs to that. Fall in
      love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself
      out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground,
      revealing him or herself differently. But the person is the same, you
      just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that
      you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
      evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We
      are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”
      The farmer said,
    <blockquote><em>"IS IT <strong class="good">GOOD</strong>? IS IT <strong class="bad">BAD</strong>? I DON'T
        KNOW."</em></blockquote> The next day the
    horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
    everybody came back and said, <blockquote><em>"OH, ISN’T THAT LUCKY. WHAT A GREAT TURN
        OF EVENTS. YOU NOW HAVE EIGHT HORSES!"</em> </blockquote> The farmer again said, <blockquote><em>“IS IT
        <strong class="good">GOOD</strong>? IS IT <strong class="bad">BAD</strong>? I DON'T KNOW."</em></blockquote> The
    following day his son tried to break
    one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
    The neighbors then said, <blockquote> <em>"OH DEAR, THAT’S TOO <strong class="bad">BAD</strong>?"</em></blockquote>
    and the farmer
    responded, <blockquote><em>
        “IS IT <strong class="good">GOOD</strong>? IS IT <strong class="bad">BAD</strong>? I DON'T KNOW.”</em>
    </blockquote> The next day the
    conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and
    they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the
    neighbors came around and said, <blockquote><em>"ISN’T THAT GREAT!” </em></blockquote>again, he said,<blockquote>
      <em>“IS
        IT <strong class="good">GOOD</strong>? IS IT <strong class="bad">BAD</strong> ?I DON'T KNOW."</em></blockquote>
    The whole process of nature is an
    integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
    tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> —
    because you
    never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never
    know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune. Alan Watts

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      <strong class="good">Good</strong> and <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are
      <strong class="good">good</strong> for monkeys, but
      monkeys are not <strong class="good">good</strong> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
